var viewModel = {};

viewModel.count = 5;
viewModel.msg = "this is a large string"; //added the word large

//[ml] the following items were added on 5/22/2012
viewModel.reportTitle = "This is the report title";	//fixed on 5/22 at 7:48a

//[ml] here is a change I made directly on the website, so it won't be on my local machine
//the idea being that this would be similar to the sceneraio
//where a change made by another user and commited
viewModel.mychange = "Blue"; //changing this at the same time as some website changes.

//this change was made locally at the same time that the file viewmodel.js was created
//it will be interesting to see what happens in the new windows githab app.

//I am adding this line on the website, while I simultaneously edit and commit the file locally
//then I will do the sync locally and see what happens.
