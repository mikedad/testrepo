This is the readme for my testrepo git project
It is a simple project, more for experimenting with git than anything
<h1>This is an h1 tag</h1>
<p>I am curious if the readme viewer in github renders html</p>
<p>And a new line in the readme too</p>

And I might as well change this file while I am at it.
