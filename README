<p>This is the readme for my testrepo git project</p>
<p>It is a simple project, more for experimenting with git than anything</p>
<h1>This is an h1 tag</h1>
<p>I am curious if the readme viewer in github renders html</p>
<p>And a new line in the readme too</p>

<p>And I might as well change this file while I am at it.</p>
<h3>Here is some h3 text I added on May 23, 2012</h3>
<p>oh, and don't forget the endline (why do I care about endlines in 2012?)</p>

<p> Here is another edit, I am experimenting with the 'sync' in the windows github app</p>
